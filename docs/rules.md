Every player can have up to 6 tiles on his hand when it is their turn.
The rest of the tiles should be stored in a bag, not visible to the players.
When a player made a move, they can restock their hand again, should there be
tiles left in the bag.

Players take turns laying down tiles from their hand, until the first person
has used all their tiles and is unable to restock their hand.

Unless it is the first move of the game, a player must always connect to another
tile when making their move.

The following rules apply when laying down tiles:
- Connected tiles must be of the same color and not repeat symbols in their row or column
- Connected tiles must be of different color and the same symbol in their row or column.
